RBLCAM001 - ML ASSIGNMENT 1

Each differant classifier has a different set of CLI that can be used to control 
certain paramters of the program. They all have default values should you not wish to enter any.
In order to get the classifiers into user input mode, please match the specified number of CLI
and finish it with the word "test". 
Should you need further clarification each program will display a USAGE format when run.


src/Classify_01:
    This is the first Model that given a number of epochs to test over and a mode number, will
    change the activation function to a differant one. 
    mode 1: tanh
    mode 2: sigmoid
    mode 3: ReLU
    mode 4: Leaky ReLU

src/Classify_02:
    This model test the Adam and SGD optimizers. No number of epochs is required here.
    mode 1: SGD
    mode 2: Adam

src/Classify_03:
    This model tests a variety of epochs and their accuracy given an epoch number in CLI.

src/Classify_04:
    This model test learning rate. No epoch number is required here.
